# GitHubRepoFetcher
This is a basic android nativ app for fetching GitHub repositories. This is a case study for an application.

### Problem to solve
Create a native mobile application. The app should show the list of most popular Github repositories â€“ and always be up-to-date. To give us an overview about the hottest projects on Github!
It should be possible to select a repository from the list. By tapping on an entry the repository information should appear in a detail view where more information about the selected repository (including the number of stars) should be displayed. The detail view should automatically refresh its content every 10 seconds to show the current number of stars.

### Requirements
* Build native App
* Code using Kotlin
* Min. API Level 21
* Use `RecyclerView`
* Use Android Architecture Components ViewModel
* Use LiveData (and or RxKotlin)
